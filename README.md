## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.



You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Make sure to also update this README to include documentation about
your project. Here's a list of some [awesome readmes][] for inspiration.

### Install the Latest Ruby Version

Verify which version of Ruby you're running by entering this in the terminal:

```sh
ruby -v
```

Make sure that the Ruby version you're running is listed in the [supported
runtimes][] by Heroku. At the time of writing, supported versions are 2.6.8,
2.7.4, or 3.0.2. Our recommendation is 2.7.4, but make sure to check the site
for the latest supported versions.

If it's not, you can use `rvm` to install a newer version of Ruby:

```sh
rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

You should also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```sh
gem install bundler
gem install rails
```

### Install NodeJS

Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```sh
node -v
```

If your Node version is not 16.x.x, install it and set it as the current and
default version with:

```sh
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
nvm alias default 16
```

You can also update your npm version with:

```sh
npm i -g npm
```
